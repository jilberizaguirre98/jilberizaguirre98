### Hi there, I'm Jilber ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Data Analysis.

- ðŸ’» I created a landing page developed with Python using the Reflex as a Framework. It allowed me to understand the hierarchy of folders, work with a color palette for a coherent visual identity and structure the page following design and usability principles. It was a key experience to strengthen my knowledge of Python and web development. 

- ðŸ’» I created a website using WordPress, designed to offer a complete experience to users. Through this platform, you can purchase various services such as yoga classes, make reservations for 1:1 meetings, and purchase physical products such as coffee, tea and other wellness related items. The website is optimized for easy navigation and provides a seamless and accessible experience for users interested in improving their wellness and exploring new offerings -> [sanarte.com](https://f067-190-145-240-37.ngrok-free.app/proyecto1/)

- ðŸ“‹ I have created an Excel file using Visual Basic and macros to provide a clear visualization of the financial flow of two small companies. This file allows for efficient analysis of financial data, which facilitates strategic decision making. The tool is designed to generate automated financial reports and summaries, which helps identify trends and areas of opportunity. With this information, more effective marketing strategies can be applied, focused on increasing sales and optimizing available resources.
