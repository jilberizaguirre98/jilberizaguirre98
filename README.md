### Hi there, I'm Jilber ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Data Analysis.

- ðŸ”­ I created a landing page developed with Python using the Reflex as a Framework. It allowed me to understand the hierarchy of folders, work with a color palette for a coherent visual identity and structure the page following design and usability principles. It was a key experience to strengthen my knowledge of Python and web development. 

- ðŸ”­ I created a website using WordPress, designed to offer a complete experience to users. Through this platform, you can purchase various services such as yoga classes, make reservations for 1:1 meetings, and purchase physical products such as coffee, tea and other wellness related items. The website is optimized for easy navigation and provides a seamless and accessible experience for users interested in improving their wellness and exploring new offerings.
