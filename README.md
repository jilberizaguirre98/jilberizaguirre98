### Hi there, I'm Jilber ðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently working as a Full Stack Developer at Central de Maderas G&S SAS. Specializing in Flutter (Dart) and Django (Python)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently creating a sales management software using Next.js, Typescript and Django, it will have integrated chat AI. Databases using PostgreSQL

- ðŸ’» I created a landing page developed with Python using Reflex as a Framework. It allowed me to understand the hierarchy of folders, work with a color palette for a coherent visual identity and structure the page following design and usability principles. It was a key experience to strengthen my knowledge of Python and web development ---> [Repository](https://github.com/jilberizaguirre98/python_web)

- ðŸ“‹ I have created an Excel file using Visual Basic and macros to provide a clear visualization of the financial flow of two small companies. This file allows for efficient analysis of financial data, which facilitates strategic decision making. The tool is designed to generate automated financial reports and summaries, which helps identify trends and areas of opportunity. With this information, more effective marketing strategies can be applied, focused on increasing sales and optimizing available resources ---> [Respository](https://github.com/jilberizaguirre98/contabilidad-tracker)
